for(s) yield e
s : is a sequence of generator and filter
e : is an expression whose value is returned by an iteration

generator: "p <- e" with p a pattern and e an expression whose value is a collection
filter: "if f" f is a boolean expression

Set is very close to Sequences but:
1. Sets are unordered
2. Sets do not have duplicate elements
3. Fundamental operation is "contains" (instead of head and tail for List)

Map[Key, Value]

Trait Option have two subclasses:
None (singleton)
Some(x) if map associate given key to x

ORDER BY =>
    sortWith : pass criteria in argument
    sorted : natural ordering

GROUP BY => Partition a collection into a Map with key -> List(value)

++ on Map  impose value of left operand over right operand
